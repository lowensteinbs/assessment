# assessment

Write a simple Java CLI that will report the download size of a given URL. Please make sure that you hit 
the following criteria:

1.       Please don't use any 3rd-party code that performs the entire task.
2.       This is meant to be simple, so no need for an HTML or GUI interface.
3.       Make sure that you provide a demonstration of your object-oriented chops.

There are 3 possible iterations:
1.       The app is a command-line app that runs 1 time. It reads the URL from a local config file and writes the size of the 
         file (PDF, image, HTML, etc.) to an output file.
         
2.       The app takes an input file that is a json array of URLs and the output file provides a json array that contains 
         each URL, its size, and the total number of requests.

The app should compile and run. Please include unit tests.
